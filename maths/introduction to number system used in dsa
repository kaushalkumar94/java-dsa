🔢 Number Systems in DSA
📌 Why It Matters in DSA?
Used in bit manipulation, memory representation, base conversions

Frequently seen in problems like:

Counting set bits

Checking power of 2

Binary addition/multiplication

Base conversion problems

💡 Common Number Systems
1. Decimal (Base-10)
Regular number system (what we use daily)

Digits: 0-9

Each digit is a power of 10

Example:
123 = 1×10² + 2×10¹ + 3×10⁰ = 100 + 20 + 3 = 123

2. Binary (Base-2)
Used in computers & digital circuits

Digits: 0, 1

Each digit is a power of 2

Example:
1011 = 1×2³ + 0×2² + 1×2¹ + 1×2⁰ = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11 (Decimal)

Applications in DSA:

Bitwise operations

Counting bits

Fast exponentiation

3. Octal (Base-8)
Digits: 0-7

Rare but used for compact binary representation (every 3 binary bits = 1 octal digit)

Example:
745 (Octal) = 7×8² + 4×8¹ + 5×8⁰ = 448 + 32 + 5 = 485 (Decimal)

Note: Less common in DSA than binary/decimal/hex

4. Hexadecimal (Base-16)
Digits: 0-9 and A-F (A=10, B=11, ..., F=15)

Used in memory addresses, color codes, hashing

Example:
1F = 1×16¹ + 15×16⁰ = 16 + 15 = 31 (Decimal)

🔁 Common Conversions
From → To	Method
Decimal → Binary	Divide by 2, store remainders in reverse
Binary → Decimal	Multiply bits by powers of 2
Decimal → Octal	Divide by 8
Decimal → Hex	Divide by 16
Binary → Octal	Group 3 bits from right
Binary → Hex	Group 4 bits from right

Copy
Edit
Integer.toBinaryString(n);      // Decimal → Binary (String)
Integer.parseInt("1010", 2);    // Binary → Decimal
Integer.toOctalString(n);       // Decimal → Octal
Integer.toHexString(n);         // Decimal → Hex




// also in this i made this file on the git hub and practices the concept of pull 
// this note is just to see the changes and i will push it on git againa 
// so remember  the steps add. commit push 
// also before the steps above don't forget to save the file
